# 🌦️ Project 13: Weather Station Logger

## 🎯 Objectives

This project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of **Python’s fundamental data types** by applying them in the context of a simulated weather monitoring system. The key objectives include:

* Applying **integers, strings, booleans, lists, arrays, and dictionaries** in real-world data processing.
* Practicing **data aggregation, condition handling, CRUD operations, and report generation**.
* Building a modular, extensible framework that simulates real-world monitoring systems.

## 📌 Project Description

The **Weather Station Logger** simulates a weather monitoring system that processes, analyzes, and reports weather-related data. Each component of the system highlights the practical use of Python’s data types:

* **Integers**: Perform calculations (totals, averages, min/max values, error counts).
* **Strings**: Generate structured and readable reports using f-strings.
* **Booleans**: Evaluate thresholds (e.g., extreme temperatures) with logical conditions.
* **Lists**: Manage, filter, and sort daily readings.
* **Arrays**: Store and process large numeric datasets efficiently.
* **Dictionaries**: Manage a CRUD-enabled station database with record-level analysis.
